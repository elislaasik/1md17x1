                    <p class="question"><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Elis Laasik (later referred as I)</p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>Eva Laanemaa</strong> (Later referred to as E) is a UX designer in a telecommunications company called Elisa Eesti AS. She manages the companies user experience team, which has 6 members. </p>

                    <p class="question"><strong>I: </strong>How did you become an UX designer?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> It was a pure coincidence. A while back I worked as a project manager, a project manager then needed to be like a full orchestra in one man. I had lots of roles in projects. Trough having many roles, first prototypes became to be and from there this new world started to interest me more and more. My UX base comes from self-practise, work, all that can be obtained by just looking around. We live in a very good time now, when information could be obtained very easily and in large quantities.</p>

                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> Two days can never be the same. There are always new challenges in each day. I have never felt boredom so far.

                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> Today, because I have my own UX-team, I don’t really have a standard workday, but a large part of my day is communicating with other teams and departments and meetings. All the best UX-ideas come, when working with a team.</p>

                    <p class="question"><strong>I:</strong> What is the hardest part of your job?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> For me personally staying calm in every situation is the hardest. For example, when people don’t want to cooperate or they are thinking on their own goals not the projects goals or the companies’ goals. It is hard to not get emotional and to stay objective, when the situation demands it.</p>

                    <p class="question"><strong>I:</strong> How do you define UX design? </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> UX is the whole experience. It should be thought of as the clients’ whole journey using the product. Within this we also count client service, banking, copywriting, and everything, which is related. For example, in a telecommunication company I only work in self-service not as a direct seller, but for the client, it is all one journey, which needs to be enjoyable.

                    <p class="question"><strong>I:</strong> How important is teamwork in your job?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> Teamwork has a large role in UX. Without good and fluent teamwork, it is impossible to create a good UX. One of the largest challenges is to make all the teams work together, because no UX designer does their solution alone. Between working in a team and alone this job requires good synergy and balance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="question"><strong>I:</strong> What are your favourite web sites? Who in the industry do you follow?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> I don’t have any specific people, sites or blogs I follow, but I recommend keeping eyes open wide. All that surrounds us is related to user experience. It is easy to google the best UX sites, but we should focus daily, how one thing can affect a product's usability and how we could offer better solutions for our clients based on that first product we thought about.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> I am most proud of my team. I think team is the base for everything and from there great projects come. (Authors note: Eva was working alone in the company at first, but she has assembled a 6 member UX team she now manages.)

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> If you’re interested in solving problems, curious, design makes your eyes shine and when you’re not afraid to ask why - UX design is one of the possibilities for you.

                    </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>E:</strong> Analyticity, curiosity (although I don’t know, how easy it is to learn), ability to work in a team are the most important skills for UX designers. No ego – not to be too egotistical and that is something, which needs to be learned from time to time. To stay calm.
